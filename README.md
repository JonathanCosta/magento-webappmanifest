Sitewards_MagentoWebAppManifest
===============================

This is an implementation of the web app manifest specification. A detailed review of this manifest may be found at the
following URL:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest 

Recently, there has been an increasing interested in a set of technologies broadly known as the "progressive web app",
or "PWA". The ionoic framework describes this as:

> A Progressive Web App (PWA) is a web app that uses modern web capabilities to deliver an app-like experience to 
> users. These apps meet certain requirements (see below), are deployed to servers, accessible through URLs, and 
> indexed by search engines.

One of the technological aspects of this is the manifest specification. The manifest providers additional, site wide
metadata about the application, such as:

- Its orientation
- Its logo
- Descriptions

etc.

Architecture
------------

Broadly, the extension is based on the https://github.com/meanbee/magento2-webappmanifest extension. This is an
implementation of the same idea, in Magento 1.x

Deployment
----------

This extension is disabled by default. If it is to be enabled you can do so through the Magento configuration tree,
or through the admin panel.
